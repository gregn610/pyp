The Pyed Piper (pyp)
====================

The original project page on Google Code here: http://code.google.com/p/pyp/

Installation
------------

    git clone https://github.com/alexbyrnes/pyp.git
    cd pyp
    chmod u+x pyp
    # Optionally: cp pyp /usr/local/bin

It's handy to put pyp into a directory on your path (for example /usr/local/bin) so you can type "pyp" instead of "./pyp".


####Background

Pyp, or The Pyed Piper, is an incredibly useful command line tool for:

* High volume transformations of unstructured data
* Operations that aren't available in Unix/Linux, or aren't easy
* Thinkers-in-python


####Usage

Filters

    cat very_large_file.csv | pyp -L " len(p) > 5 " > only_long_lines.csv

Regular Expressions

    cat very_large_file.csv | pyp -L " p.re('[0-9a-fA-F]*') " > only_hex_digits.csv

Compose multiple operations

    cat very_large_file.csv | pyp -L " p.upper() | whitespace | p[:2] " > first_two_colums_uppercase.csv

Many more examples in the [manual](https://code.google.com/p/pyp/wiki/pyp_manual), and in examples.sh


####Running the Tests

    python setup.py test

This will test pyp under multiple versions of python. If you only need to test
a single version of python you can do this instead:

    python setup.py test -a "-epy27"


####Making the C version (requires Cython)

    make test

This will output a binary `cyp` and test it with a simple command.


#####What's New

* -L flag for large (> 50,000 line) files
* --DEBUG to debug output with line numbers and stack trace
* -D to output tab delimited text.  The large file flag includes this automatically.  Add -S to specify the delimiter.
* "cyp" compiled version
* Optimizations -- p.file, p.dir, and p.ext moved to p.file(), p.dir(), p.ext()
